### **Requirement Fulfillment Analysis**

The system addresses most of the requirements outlined in your description. Here's a detailed evaluation:

---

### **1. REMOVE**
- **Requirement**: No outputs should include data from `Component: System` and `Folder`.
- **Fulfillment**: ✅ Implemented in the `clean_data` function. Rows containing "System" or "Folder" in the `Component` column are removed.

---

### **2. RENAME**
- **Requirement**: Rename the column `User Full Name *Anonymized` to `User_ID` in both `ACTIVITY_LOG` and `USER_LOG`.
- **Fulfillment**: ✅ Implemented in the `rename_columns` function.

---

### **3. MERGE**
- **Requirement**: Merge `ACTIVITY_LOG` and `USER_LOG` for analyzing user interactions with each component.
- **Fulfillment**: ✅ Implemented in the `merge_datasets` function.

---

### **4. RESHAPE**
- **Requirement**: Reshape the data using a pivot operation.
- **Fulfillment**: ✅ Implemented in the `reshape_data` function.

---

### **5. COUNT**
- **Requirement**: Add interaction counts per user with each component for each month.
- **Fulfillment**: ✅ Implemented in the `add_monthly_interactions` function. The function calculates the monthly interaction counts and adds the `Month` field.

---

### **6. OUTPUT STATISTICS**
- **Requirement**: Produce mean, mode, and median for components (`Quiz`, `Lecture`, `Assignment`, `Attendance`, `Survey`):
  - **a. For each month**: ✅ Fulfilled with the `calculate_statistics` function when grouped by `Month`.
  - **b. For the entire semester**: ✅ Fulfilled with the `calculate_statistics` function when applied to the entire dataset.

---

### **7. OUTPUT CORRELATION**
- **Requirement**: Produce a graph to visualize correlations between `User_ID` and `Component` interactions for components like `Assignment`, `Quiz`, `Lecture`, `Book`, `Project`, and `Course`.
- **Fulfillment**: ✅ Implemented in the `plot_correlation` function using a heatmap visualization.

---

### **8. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Usability**: Intuitive GUI planned with clear buttons for all operations. Logs and status messages provide user feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Exception handling is implemented in `load_csv`, `clean_data`, and other functions.
- **Performance**: Uses Pandas for efficient data handling and supports chunking (can be added as needed for larger datasets).
- **Scalability**: Modular design allows easy adaptation for similar datasets.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Testing**:
   - Verify the functionality with sample datasets to ensure all outputs meet expectations.
   - Test edge cases, such as missing columns or invalid values.

2. **GUI Integration**:
   - Build the Tkinter interface to integrate the backend functions with user interaction.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Include usage instructions, screenshots, and justifications for design choices.
